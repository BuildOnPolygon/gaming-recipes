# Documentation Guidelines

This guideline focuses on best practices for writing technical documentation and style conventions when developing documentation for contributions. This guide aims to help potential contributors and anyone interested in contributing to documentation write clear, concise, and consistent material.

> This guideline takes inspiration from the following style manuals. If you are unable to find the answer to a style, voice, or terminology question in this guide, please consult these resources:

## Share the Experience with the Reader

- Use the first-person point of view sparingly and with intention. When overused, the first-person narrative can overwhelm the sense of a shared experience and obscure the reader's journey.
- Address the reader directly, using a second-person point of view in most cases.
- Use present tense whenever possible, and use passive voice when the agent needs to be the focus.
- Use gender-neutral pronouns, like "they," whenever possible.
- Be wary of impersonal and potentially ambiguous pronouns.
- Keep the human presence in mind: having a dynamic tone when describing technical concepts helps readers connect with the material.

### Being Swift and Concise

- Use common, well-known words whenever possible.
- Avoid jargon, colloquialisms, and idiomatic phrases.
- Avoid adverbs and subjective statements.
- Don't use phrases that introduce ambiguity.
- Pay extra attention to word choice.
- Avoid exclamation marks.
- Use a conversational tone that is informal but should still be professional.
- Avoid adding unnecessary words or phrases.
- Use contractions to give documentation a more natural conversational tone.

### Clarity

- Use "for example" instead of "e.g.,"
- Use "that is" or rewrite the sentence to make the meaning clear without needing extra qualification instead of "i.e.,"
- Use "and so on" or revise the content to make the term unnecessary instead of "etc."
- Use an appropriate English substitute such as "notice," "caution," or "warning" instead of "caveat."
